First, analyze if this query result can benefit from Python analysis:\n   - Does it have meaningful numerical data to analyze?\n   - Are there trends, patterns, or visualizations that would add value?\n   - Would statistical analysis provide insights beyond the raw data?\n   - If NO to all above, set \"skipAnalysis\": true with explanation\n\n2. If analysis IS appropriate, create a UNIQUE script that:\n   - Is specifically tailored to THIS query's data structure and user intent\n   - Uses only the available dependencies listed above\n   - If you need other packages, list them in \"missingDependencies\" array\n   - Handles the ACTUAL column names and data types from the sample\n   - Creates meaningful outputs (charts, statistics, summaries) based on the data\n\n3. Script Requirements:\n   - 'df' variable contains the query results as a pandas DataFrame\n   - Use 'output_dir' for saving files: os.path.join(output_dir, 'filename.ext')\n   - Handle NULL/missing values appropriately\n   - Include proper error handling for data type conversions\n   - Generate files with descriptive names related to the analysis\n\n4. Be CREATIVE and SPECIFIC:\n   - For sales data: trend analysis, seasonality, top performers\n   - For product data: category analysis, price distributions, inventory insights\n   - For customer data: segmentation, behavior patterns, lifetime value\n   - For time-series: forecasting, anomaly detection, period comparisons\n   - Match the analysis to the user's actual question intent",
